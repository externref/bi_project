##  Mathematical Model
- **[Supply Chain Expert System: Supply-Chain-Optimizer](https://github.com/RiturajSingh2004/Supply-Chain-Optimizer)**

##  Data Model

The system operates on the following key data entities:

- **Sales Data** - Historical sales records
- **Suppliers Data** - Supplier information and performance metrics
- **Inventory Data** - Current stock levels and parameters
- **Product Master Data** - Product specifications and pricing
- **External Factors Data** - Market conditions and environmental factors

##  Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-optimizer.git
   cd supply-chain-optimizer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure SQLite database path is correct:
   ```
   ./supply_chain_data/supply_chain_data.db
   ```

##  Usage

### Running the Expert System

```python
from expert_system import SQLiteSupplyChainExpertSystem

# Initialize the expert system
expert = SQLiteSupplyChainExpertSystem()

# Run the analysis
expert.run_expert_analysis()

# Close connection when done
expert.close()
```

### Using the Optimization Engine

```python
from SQLiteSupplyChainOptimizer import SQLiteSupplyChainOptimizer

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = SQLiteSupplyChainOptimizer()

# Use various optimization functions
forecast = optimizer.demand_forecasting(forecast_horizon=120)
supplier_analysis = optimizer.supplier_analysis()
inventory_recommendations = optimizer.inventory_optimization()
risks = optimizer.risk_assessment()

# Generate comprehensive report
report = optimizer.generate_report(report_type='all')
```

### Starting the API Server

```bash
python backend.py
```

The server will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.

### API Usage Examples

**Fetch Sales Data:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/sales?limit=10&category=Electronics
```

**Add New Supplier:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"New Supplier", "location":"Chicago", "price_rating":0.85, "quality_rating":0.9, "delivery_time":7, "reliability_score":0.92}' http://localhost:5000/api/suppliers
```

**Update Inventory Record:**
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"product_id":"P1001", "category":"Electronics", "current_stock":150, "safety_stock_level":50, "reorder_point":75}' http://localhost:5000/api/inventory/1
```

**Delete Product Record:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/products/5
```

##  Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Supplier Analysis Weights

```python
criteria_weights = {
    'price_rating': 0.35,       # Higher priority on price
    'quality_rating': 0.30,     # Strong emphasis on quality
    'delivery_time': 0.15,      # Less emphasis on delivery time
    'reliability_score': 0.15,  # Less emphasis on reliability
    'financial_stability_score': 0.05  # Minimal emphasis on financials
}

supplier_analysis = optimizer.supplier_analysis(criteria_weights=criteria_weights)
```

### Specific Product Inventory Optimization

```python
# Optimize inventory for a specific product
product_optimization = optimizer.inventory_optimization(product_id='P1001')
```

### Custom Report Generation

```python
# Generate a report focused on risk assessment
risk_report = optimizer.generate_report(report_type='risk')
```

##  Design Patterns & Architecture

The system follows several key design patterns:

1. **Repository Pattern** - Database access is abstracted through query methods
2. **Strategy Pattern** - Different optimization algorithms can be selected
3. **Factory Pattern** - Report generation based on report type
4. **Facade Pattern** - Simplified interface to complex optimization subsystems

The architecture separates concerns into:
- **Data Access Layer** - SQLite connection and queries
- **Business Logic Layer** - Optimization algorithms and analysis
- **API Layer** - RESTful endpoints for integration

##  Data Flow

1. Raw data from various sources is stored in SQLite database
2. Data is preprocessed during optimization operations
3. Machine learning models analyze patterns and generate forecasts
4. Optimization algorithms calculate ideal parameters
5. Results are made available through the API or direct method calls
6. Frontend systems can visualize and interact with the data

##  Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- SQLite connection errors
- Data preprocessing issues
- Machine learning model failures
- API request validation

All errors are logged with appropriate detail level for debugging.

##  Security Considerations

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- No direct SQL queries (preventing SQL injection)
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- CORS configuration for controlled API access

##  Performance Optimization

- Efficient SQLite queries with appropriate indices
- Caching of machine learning models in memory
- Pagination for large dataset queries
- Targeted SQL queries to minimize data transfer
